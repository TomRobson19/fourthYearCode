abstract = {With the increasing growth of technology and the entrance into the digital age, we have to handle a vast amount of information every time which often presents difficulties. So, the digital information must be stored and retrieved in an efficient and effective manner, in order for it to be put to practical use. Wavelets provide a mathematical way of encoding information in such a way that it is layered according to level of detail. This layering facilitates approximations at various intermediate stages. These approximations can be stored using a lot less space than the original data. Here a low complex 2D image compression method using wavelets as the basis functions and the approach to measure the quality of the compressed image are presented. The particular wavelet chosen and used here is the simplest wavelet form namely the Haar Wavelet. The 2D discret wavelet transform (DWT) has been applied and the detail matrices from the information matrix of the image have been estimated. The reconstructed image is synthesized using the estimated detail matrices and information matrix provided by the Wavelet transform. The quality of the compressed images has been evaluated using some factors like Compression Ratio (CR), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Opinion Score (MOS), Picture Quality Scale (PQS) etc.},

Transform coding, on the other hand, first transforms the image from its spatial domain representation to a different type of representation using some well-known transform and then codes the transformed values (coefficients). Image compression is urgently needed for very large medical or satellite images, both for reducing the storage requirements and for improving transmission efficiency. Fourier based transforms (e.g. DCT and DFT) are efficient in exploiting the low frequency nature of an image. The high frequency coefficients are coarsely quantized, and hence the reconstructed quality of the image at the edges will have poor quality. On the other hand, wavelets are efficient in representing nonstationary signals because of the adaptive time-frequency window. So the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is applied to an image and the energy compaction performance of both Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and DWT is compared. It is observed that both transforms provide comparable energy compaction performance.},
