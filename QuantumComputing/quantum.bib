abstract = {Fundamental questions in chemistry and physics may never be answered due to the exponential com-plexity of the underlying quantum phenomena. A desire to overcome this challenge has sparked a new industry of quantum technologies with the promise that engineered quantum systems can address these hard problems. A key step towards demonstrating such a system will be performing a computation beyond the capabilities of any classical computer, achieving so-called quantum supremacy. Here, us-ing 9 superconducting qubits, we demonstrate an immediate path towards quantum supremacy. By individually tuning the qubit parameters, we are able to generate thousands of unique Hamiltonian evolutions and probe the output probabilities. The measured probabilities obey a universal distribu-tion, consistent with uniformly sampling the full Hilbert-space. As the number of qubits in the algo-rithm is varied, the system continues to explore the exponentially growing number of states. Combining these large datasets with techniques from machine learning allows us to construct a model which ac-curately predicts the measured probabilities. We demonstrate an application of these algorithms by systematically increasing the disorder and observ-ing a transition from delocalized states to localized states. By extending these results to a system of 50 qubits, we hope to address scientific questions that are beyond the capabilities of any classical com-puter. A programmable quantum system consisting of merely 50 to 100 qubits could revolutionize scientific research. While such a platform is naturally suited to address problems in quantum chemistry and materials science [1–4], applications range to fields as far as classical dynamics [5] and computer science [6–9]. A key milestone on the path towards realizing these applications will be the demonstration of an algorithm which exceeds the capabilities of any classical computer -achieving quantum supremacy [10]. Sampling problems are an iconic example of algorithms designed specifically for this purpose [11–14]. A successful demonstration of quan-tum supremacy would prove that engineered quantum sys-tems, while still in their infancy, can outperform the most advanced classical computers. Consider a system of coupled qubits whose dynamics uni-formly explore all accessible states over time. The com-plexity of simulating this evolution on a classical computer is easy to understand and quantify. Since every state is equally important, it is not possible to simplify the prob-lem, using a smaller truncated state-space. The complexity is then simply given by asking how much classical mem-ory does it take to store the state-vector. Storing the state of a 46-qubit system takes nearly a petabyte of memory and is at the limit of the most powerful computers [14, 15]. Sampling from the output probabilities of such a system would therefore constitute a clear demonstration of quan-tum supremacy. Note that this is only an upper bound on the number of qubits required -other constraints, such as computation time, may place practical limitations on even smaller system sizes. Here, we experimentally illustrate a blueprint for demon-strating quantum supremacy. We present data character-izing two basic ingredients required for any supremacy ex-periment: complexity and fidelity. First, we demonstrate that the qubits can uniformly explore the Hilbert-space, providing a direct measure of algorithm complexity. Next, we compare the measurement results with the expected be-havior and show that the algorithm can be implemented with high fidelity. Experiments for probing complexity and fidelity provide a foundation for demonstrating quantum supremacy. The more control a quantum platform offers, the easier Figure 1. Device: nine-qubit array.

abstract = {A critical question for the field of quantum computing in the near future is whether quantum devices without error correction can perform a well-defined computational task beyond the capabil-ities of state-of-the-art classical computers, achieving so-called quantum supremacy. We study the task of sampling from the output distributions of (pseudo-)random quantum circuits, a natural task for benchmarking quantum computers. Crucially, sampling this distribution classically requires a direct numerical simulation of the circuit, with computational cost exponential in the number of qubits. This requirement is typical of chaotic systems. We extend previous results in computational complexity to argue more formally that this sampling task must take exponential time in a classical computer. We study the convergence to the chaotic regime using extensive supercomputer simula-tions, modeling circuits with up to 42 qubits -the largest quantum circuits simulated to date for a computational task that approaches quantum supremacy. We argue that while chaotic states are extremely sensitive to errors, quantum supremacy can be achieved in the near-term with approxi-mately fifty superconducting qubits. We introduce cross entropy as a useful benchmark of quantum circuits which approximates the circuit fidelity. We show that the cross entropy can be efficiently measured when circuit simulations are available. Beyond the classically tractable regime, the cross entropy can be extrapolated and compared with theoretical estimates of circuit fidelity to define a practical quantum supremacy test.},
